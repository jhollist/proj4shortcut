Description: Most spatial packages in R rely on Proj.4 strings for defining 
             coordinate reference systems.  While it is possible to simply 
             specify the full string as a character vector, the details of the 
             string must usually be looked up.  This package provides shortcuts 
             through functions with names (entirely determined by the 
             contributors of this package!) that return the full specified 
             Proj.4 string.
